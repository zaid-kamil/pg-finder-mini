            <p>
                PG-Finder has been great for us in the past. We've stayed in several places and states and have never
                had a complaint - all have been 5 stars until Sue in Grand Lake, CO cancelled our booking and asked
                almost 3 times the advertised price we paid. I booked at $59 per night which seemed too good to be true.
                I wasn't too happy when the booking was finalized to see that it was actually a lodge, But for the place
                , time, and price, I was thrilled. Immediately after booking, I emailed the host to say how much we were
                looking forward to our visit next year. Within a few minutes I got an email from her saying it was a
                mistake, she cancelled our reservation and offered for us to book again at the rate of $149 per night.

                definitely go for PG Finder.
